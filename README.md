# WhamBamThankYouSpam
The ultimate BOT in AI Job Seeking Automation 

# Initial Overview
The goal with this project is to create a Python application that will help a user to find job roles and apply for them for the user.

It will allow the user to load a list of target companies, industries, and job titles.
It will also help generate a list of target companies, industries, and roles.

It will allow the user to upload their resume, mission statement, and scenario based answers (based on their targeted jobs).

It will search through the list of target companies and identify current job openings that match or near match the users targeted job titles. It will also do expanded search to additional, similar companies and return the job openings.

It will then scour the internet to find contact information for folks in that company related to the target role, along with their linked in profile, email address, and telephone numbers.

It will then create a targeted resume based on the job requirements, and a 2 cover letters - one cover letter to be used to apply for the job, the other cover letter to email individuals associated with the job.

It will store all this information in a Google Drive share and tracking information in a Google Sheet.

It will then SPAM out emails with the cover letter (targeted individual) to the individuals identified in the process.

It will keep track of status in the google sheet (searched, applied, results), as well as individuals it emailed to prevent double connecting.
